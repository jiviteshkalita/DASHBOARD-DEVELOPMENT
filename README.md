Description: This project is developed using Microsoft Power BI, a leading business intelligence (BI) and data visualization platform. Power BI allows users to import, model, and visualize large datasets interactively. It’s widely used across industries to build real-time dashboards, perform trend analysis, and gain insights from raw data through visually intuitive reports.
The dataset includes information on cybersecurity threats globally over a period of nearly a decade (2015–2024). It likely includes:

Types of threats (e.g., malware, ransomware, phishing)

Frequency of incidents

Geographic locations of attacks

Year-wise trends

Industries affected

Impact metrics (e.g., financial loss, systems compromised)

This kind of dataset is critical for cybersecurity analysts, IT decision-makers, and policy professionals to monitor, prepare for, and mitigate cyber risks.

Project Objectives:
The main goal of this Power BI project is to:

Track the evolution of cyber threats over time.

Identify geographic and industry-wise hotspots for cybersecurity breaches.

Analyze the most frequent and damaging types of attacks.

Provide insights that can inform strategic cybersecurity planning and resource allocation.

Key Features of the Dashboard:
Though the .pbix file itself is not directly viewable here, a standard Power BI cybersecurity threat dashboard using such data would typically include:

Interactive Time-Series Charts: Showing the number and type of attacks per year.

Geographic Heat Maps: Visualizing global distribution of cyber incidents.

Threat Category Filters: Allowing users to drill down into specific types of threats such as phishing, DDoS attacks, or insider threats.

Industry Breakdown: Highlighting which sectors (e.g., healthcare, finance, energy) are most frequently targeted.

Severity & Impact Scores: Bar or pie charts comparing threats by the estimated damage or cost.

Dynamic Slicers: For filtering data by year, region, or threat type, enabling custom analyses.

Applications:
This type of BI dashboard is highly applicable in multiple domains:

Cybersecurity Operations: Helps security teams track ongoing threats and prioritize defenses.

Policy Making: Enables government and regulatory bodies to assess risk landscapes and enforce compliance.

Corporate Risk Management: Assists in budget allocation and investment in cybersecurity infrastructure.

Awareness Training: Used in training sessions to show real data and increase awareness of emerging threats.

Academic and Research: Assists in analyzing patterns for papers and whitepapers on digital threat intelligence.
